# Essay Writer AI Agent Experiment

This README outlines the functionality and structure of the "Essay Writer" AI agent experiment. The project is designed to assist users with creating essays by guiding them through planning, researching, writing, and revising stages in a structured manner.

---

## Overview

The "Essay Writer" AI agent operates using a defined workflow that includes **planning**, **researching**, **generating**, and **reflecting** on essays. The process is iterative and interactive, ensuring high-quality output while allowing for user feedback and improvements.

## Workflow Stages

1. **Plan**  
   - **Role**: Expert writer  
   - **Task**: Write a high-level outline of the essay. This includes:
     - Structuring the essay into key sections.
     - Providing notes or instructions for each section.  

2. **Research Plan**  
   - **Role**: Researcher  
   - **Task**: Generate a list of search queries (up to 3) to gather relevant information for the essay.  

3. **Generate**  
   - **Role**: Essay assistant  
   - **Task**: Write a complete 5-paragraph essay based on the outline and research results. The assistant also integrates user-provided critique in subsequent iterations.  

4. **Reflect**  
   - **Role**: Reviewer  
   - **Task**: Respond to user critique by revising the essay or suggesting refinements to the structure and content.  

5. **Research Critique**  
   - If needed, refine the research queries or suggest improvements based on gaps identified during the reflection process.

## Key Features

- **Iterative Workflow**: The AI iteratively improves its output by incorporating user feedback at every step.  
- **Role-Based Design**: The AI assumes specific roles (e.g., writer, researcher, reviewer) to focus on different stages of the writing process.  
- **Search Query Optimization**: The research stage provides concise, targeted search queries to gather relevant information efficiently.  
- **Reflective Revision**: The AI evaluates and revises the essay based on structured feedback, ensuring a higher-quality final product.

## Use Cases

- **Academic Essays**: Develop detailed essays with structured arguments and well-researched content.  
- **Professional Writing**: Create high-quality written content for reports, proposals, or other professional contexts.  
- **Learning Assistance**: Assist students in understanding the writing process and producing better essays.

## How It Works

1. **Start with a topic**: Provide the AI with a topic or subject for the essay.  
2. **Outline creation**: The AI generates a high-level essay outline.  
3. **Research queries**: The AI suggests targeted search queries to gather data.  
4. **Essay generation**: The AI writes a 5-paragraph essay using the outline and research.  
5. **Feedback loop**: Users provide critique, and the AI revises the essay accordingly.

## Limitations

- The AI can only generate a maximum of 3 research queries per iteration.  
- The essay structure is limited to 5 paragraphs by default.

This experiment is a step toward building sophisticated AI tools that assist in structured and creative writing processes while incorporating iterative feedback for continuous improvement.
