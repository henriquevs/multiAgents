      "​Crew Attributes\n",
      "AttributeParametersDescriptionTaskstasksA list of tasks assigned to the crew.AgentsagentsA list of agents that are part of the crew.Process (optional)processThe process flow (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) the crew follows. Default is sequential.Verbose (optional)verboseThe verbosity level for logging during execution. Defaults to False.Manager LLM (optional)manager_llmThe language model used by the manager agent in a hierarchical process. Required when using a hierarchical process.Function Calling LLM (optional)function_calling_llmIf passed, the crew will use this LLM to do function calling for tools for all agents in the crew. Each agent can have its own LLM, which overrides the crew’s LLM for function calling.Config (optional)configOptional configuration settings for the crew, in Json or Dict[str, Any] format.Max RPM (optional)max_rpmMaximum requests per minute the crew adheres to during execution. Defaults to None.Language (optional)languageLanguage used for the crew, defaults to English.Language File (optional)language_filePath to the language file to be used for the crew.Memory (optional)memoryUtilized for storing execution memories (short-term, long-term, entity memory). Defaults to False.Cache (optional)cacheSpecifies whether to use a cache for storing the results of tools’ execution. Defaults to True.Embedder (optional)embedderConfiguration for the embedder to be used by the crew. Mostly used by memory for now. Default is {\"provider\": \"openai\"}.Full Output (optional)full_outputWhether the crew should return the full output with all tasks outputs or just the final output. Defaults to False.Step Callback (optional)step_callbackA function that is called after each step of every agent. This can be used to log the agent’s actions or to perform other operations; it won’t override the agent-specific step_callback.Task Callback (optional)task_callbackA function that is called after the completion of each task. Useful for monitoring or additional operations post-task execution.Share Crew (optional)share_crewWhether you want to share the complete crew information and execution with the crewAI team to make the library better, and allow us to train models.Output Log File (optional)output_log_fileWhether you want to have a file with the complete crew output and execution. You can set it using True and it will default to the folder you are currently in and it will be called logs.txt or passing a string with the full path and name of the file.Manager Agent (optional)manager_agentmanager sets a custom agent that will be used as a manager.Manager Callbacks (optional)manager_callbacksmanager_callbacks takes a list of callback handlers to be executed by the manager agent when a hierarchical process is used.Prompt File (optional)prompt_filePath to the prompt JSON file to be used for the crew.Planning (optional)planningAdds planning ability to the Crew. When activated before each Crew iteration, all Crew data is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks and this plan will be added to each task description.Planning LLM (optional)planning_llmThe language model used by the AgentPlanner in a planning process.\n",
