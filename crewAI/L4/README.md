# Automated Lead Generation and Personalized Outreach

This project automates the lead generation and personalized outreach process by coordinating two main agents in CrewAI. The Sales Representative identifies high-value leads, while the Lead Sales Representative crafts personalized outreach strategies to engage decision-makers.

## Key Components

- **Agents**: Two agents focus on distinct tasks to drive lead engagement:
  - **Sales Representative**: Gathers detailed insights on potential leads using multiple data sources.
  - **Lead Sales Representative**: Develops personalized outreach materials that connect our solutions to the lead's needs.

- **Tasks**: The agents are assigned tasks as follows:
  - **Lead Profiling**: Analyzes a lead's background, key personnel, milestones, and potential needs.
  - **Personalized Outreach**: Crafts targeted messages for decision-makers, tailored to their companyâ€™s recent achievements.

## Usage Overview

1. **Define Agents and Tasks**
   - Configures CrewAI agents and tasks for lead profiling and outreach strategy development.
2. **Run Lead Engagement Process**

3. **Display Result**
