# Automated Financial Trading Strategy Development

This project automates the development and execution of trading strategies through a coordinated team of specialized agents. Each agent in the CrewAI setup performs a distinct role, from market data analysis to trade execution and risk management.

## Key Components

- **Agents**: Four agents handle the trading strategy lifecycle:
  - **Data Analyst**: Monitors and analyzes market data to identify trends and forecast movements.
  - **Trading Strategy Developer**: Develops potential trading strategies based on data insights and user-defined risk tolerance.
  - **Trade Advisor**: Plans optimal trade execution, factoring in market conditions and pricing.
  - **Risk Advisor**: Assesses the risk associated with trading activities and suggests mitigations.

- **Tasks**: Each agent is assigned specific tasks:
  - **Market Data Analysis**: Continuous monitoring and insights for chosen stocks.
  - **Strategy Development**: Strategy proposals aligning with risk tolerance and trading preferences.
  - **Trade Execution Planning**: Suggestions on optimal trade execution timing and method.
  - **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk analysis with mitigation strategies.

## Usage Overview

1. **Define Agents and Tasks**
   - Configures CrewAI agents and tasks for data analysis, strategy development, execution planning, and risk management.
2. **Run Financial Trading Workflow**
   - Input stock and trading details, then execute the crew to develop, analyze, and plan trading strategies.
3. **Display Result**
   - Outputs insights and structured recommendations for trading and risk management.

### Example Code

```python
# Define trading inputs
financial_trading_inputs = {
    'stock_selection': 'AAPL',
    'initial_capital': '100000',
    'risk_tolerance': 'Medium',
    'trading_strategy_preference': 'Day Trading'
}

# Run Crew
result = financial_trading_crew.kickoff(inputs=financial_trading_inputs)

# Display Results
